# SisonkeBankApp

Sisonke Banke App was a class project which I completed in my 3rd year of studies. 
The project required mt to make a simple bank app which makes use of the SQLiteOpenHelper class. 
The app allows you to create a new account, with validation of all the fields. Once created it will save the new user onto a local SQLite database.
When logging in, validation of fields orccur (is the mail format correct etc.) and it will check if the user exists and if the password matches. 
Once logged in, users will be able to see the balance of their accounts and make transfers between the accounts. 

This was my first time working with android studio and it was a great way to familiarize myself with the software.
